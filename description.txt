Little study of question:

How many 1's occur in the result of some operations"
such as *, +, and so on?

METHOD: Loop two unsigned char a, b from 0 to 0xff.
This gives (1 << 8) * (1 << 8) * 8 [number of bits
in unsigned char) bits in the resulting unsigned
char a * b, a + b, etc. 

Note that (1 << 8) * (1 << 8) * 8 = (1 << 19). 
Do a total popcount (count number of 1's) in all
the resulting unsigned chars, divide this number
by (1 << 19). This gives occurrence of 1's.

RESULTS: ^ (bitwise XOR) is totally balanced: 
Probability of occurrence of 1 is 0.500. 
The same holds - somewhat surprisingly - for + .
Probability of occurrence of 1's is a bit 
lower for multiplication (*) : 0.437.
